# Foot-recognition-biomimetic-robot
Hi! We are UmmJocker. This is our university project. 

Our training code is the same as the code https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

We use the code to build a foot/shoes recognition model 
and combine realtime recognition, ultrasonic detector and motor with python code to control the biomimetic robot.
